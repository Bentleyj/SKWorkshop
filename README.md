# SunriseKingdomWorkshop

This is the repo for holding the code for the sunrise kingdom CMS Crosslab Workshop.

## Basic Terminal Navigation

To run anything in this project you want to be familiar with navigating your computer using the terminal. The terminal is basically another way of controlling your computer without your mouse. Before Apple invented the mouse and the desktop this is all computers ever did!

Firstly we need to open the terminal application on our computer which you can find using spotlight and searching for terminal. Once you've got it open you'll find you can type in to an empty text field. By typing in commands and pressing Enter you can tell your computer to do different things. Mostly we'll be using the command line to navigate to folders and run commands. To navigate to folders we want to use 2 commands: `cd` which stands for "Change Directory" and `ls` which stands for "List". By using `cd` you cna change which directory you are in and by using `ls` you can list the files and directories within your current directory. If you want a primer on how to navigate the command line one is available [here](https://learn.co/lessons/bash-navigation-osx).

## Initial setup

To use this project we need to do a little bit of setup. Firstly we need to install node.js which is a javascript library which is extremely powerful. We won't be using it for this project directly but we will be using utilities that it provides.

### cppExamples

This holds some examples in C++ of how to do very basic things. We'll start off with just a plain HelloWorold project.

To run the HelloWorld project you need to compile it using the command line. Compiling is basically translating our code from C++ in to a language the machine can understand (called Machine code).

Once you're in the correct directory in the terminal you need to type the following command to compile your application:

`g++ HelloWorld.cpp -o hello`

This will compile your application and saved the compiled application as a second file called "hello" because we specified that as the name. g++ is the name of the compiler, HelloWorld.cpp is the name of the file to be compiled, -o means "The next thing I type will be the name of my output file" and hello is thereby the name we have chosen for our output file.

To run your application once it's been compiled just type the following in to the command line:

`./hello`

We can make this work with any basic cpp file. If you want to make changes to the cpp file simply ammend the file, save it, and compile it via the command line again using the above command. It will automatically overwrite the previous file. When you're writing code you might make errors which means compiling it might fail. These are called "compile errors" and will be reported to you when you compile so you can fix any mistakes in your code.

### node_modules

This file is automatically generated when we run the command:

`npm install`

It holds all of our npm modules to run node commands. We won't ever need to use it.

### p5

This is out project file. Inside is a full installation of p5.js which you can also get from [here](https://p5js.org/download/). Within this project there are several example projects labelled with the prefix test_XXXXXXX. there are three other folders which are used by p5.js: addons, libs and shared. You can ignore these. Finally to get any examples that load images to work you will need to create a folder titled assets if one is not already there within the p5 folder. Inside assets you need to unzip the SKWorkshopImages folder so the folder structure looks like p5>assets>SKWorkshopImages>[lots of images].

In order to run the projects you need to have installed http-server as described above. navigate to the p5 folder in the command line and

### P5 project

This is a fun project file, we'll be using p5.js to draw out images and play around with them.

To launch this locally we want to follow the instructions [here](https://p5js.org/get-started/) for getting started with p5.js and [here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server) for setting up a local server which we'll need to load our files. We;re going to use Sublime Text 3 as our IDE which you can download from [here](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

Some notes on getting setup, we're going to use the Node option to set everything up because we'll be installing node.js anyway. Don't forget to install http-server globally and make sure to run it with the flags:

`http-server -c-1`

And make sure you run it **IN THE P5.JS FOLDER** not in your example folder.
