# SunriseKingdomWorkshop

This is the repo for holding the code for the sunrise kingdom CMS Crosslab Workshop.

We'll be building a Node.js sorter, an mBox parser and a p5.js viewer

To run ourMBox parser you need to allocate additional memory for the node.js app because out Mbox file is to large.

to do this do the following: `node --max-old-space-size=9216 parseMbox.js`
